# üìö AI Study Buddy: Abstractive Text Summarizer

This project is an **end-to-end web application** that generates high-quality, fluent summaries from any long English text. It demonstrates key skills in **Transfer Learning**, **Deep Learning Deployment**, and **MLOps**.

## ‚ú® Project Highlights & Technical Stack

| Feature | Description | Key Skill Demonstrated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Abstractive Summarization** | The application is built around the **BART-Large-CNN Transformer** model, which generates **new, coherent sentences** (mimicking human summarization). | **Transfer Learning**, **Seq2Seq Architecture** (Encoder-Decoder). |
| **Model Selection** | Chose the **BART-CNN** model specifically because it was fine-tuned on the large **CNN/Daily Mail** news dataset, guaranteeing top-tier English summarization quality. | **Model Evaluation/Selection**, **Deep Learning Optimization**. |
| **Deployment** | The entire Python backend is wrapped in an interactive front-end using **Streamlit**. | **MLOps Lite**, **End-to-End Delivery**, and **Web Application Deployment**. |
| **Scalability Awareness** | The design includes a clear plan for **Hierarchical Summarization** to overcome the model's **1024-token context window limit**. | **MLOps Pipeline Design**, **Scaling Solutions**. |
